This is the Tutorial notes for git and Github


git init          -> to initialize git in the folder (it makes .git hidden folder inside the folder)

cmd + shift + .   -> to see hidden file and folder in mac

// but files in the folder still untracked

git add <fileName> -> to enable tracking on a specific file
// now tracking started in file <fileName>

git diff         -> show the difference in files (what new adds{+} and what remove{-})

git add .     -> to enable tracking on all files in the folder 

git remove <fileName>   -> to disable tracking on a specific file in the folder

git commit -m "mssg"  -> to save the changes along with a message (& git diff clear ho jayga)

git log            -> to see the history of commits
git log --oneline  -> to see the history of each commit in single line

git show <commitId>  -> to see the changes for specific commit

git blame <fileName>  -> to see when who made what changes in the file(fileName)

git status   -> tell which files are modified

// i write something wrong in code

// github is a centralized remote server jahan p hum apna commit push kr sakte hein, un commits 
// ko koi bhi pull skta hai jisse code consistent rehta hai or ek history maintain rehti hai.
